# AFREP (NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE YET (18DEC2024)) 

AFREP = Air Force Repair Enhancment Program. A section within the 57 MXG that focuses on repairing parts deemed unreparable by normal maintanence. 

## Problem

One of AFREP's tools is a machine called AWTS (Automatic Wire Test Set) that functions as a multimeter and allows for rapid testing of individual or component parts both on plane and off plane. 

The problem is that AWTS's programatic interface is terrible, it requires a VBA-esque code that is not user friendly to write or read. 

## Goal

Develop a GUI interface that allows human readable input to be turned into computer code that can be used to test a variety of different components.
